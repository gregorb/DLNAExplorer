Learning my way around UPnP and DLNA.

Completed steps:

step 1: UDP UPnP discovery <br/>
step 2: getting info about the devices found on the net <br/>
step 3: getting info about the services found on each device <br/>

Coming up next:

step 4: getting list of commands the device services support, maybe calling some <br/>
step 5: being able to push an image or video to a render device would be nice <br/>
